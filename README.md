# Hack_4_climate-10
A climate solution project for Hack4climate program. A collaborative project for 5.
In the heart of bustling urban centers, a deeply concerning issue unfolds: the alarming repercussions of poor waste disposal that seep insidiously into the environment.
Amidst the cluttered streets and overflowing bins, a sinister narrative takes shape as waste, discarded with reckless abandon, finds its way into the delicate fabric of the ecosystem. 
The consequences of this negligence are profound, as pollutants infiltrate the air, contaminate water sources, and poison the soil. Wildlife suffers, habitats degrade, and the delicate balance of nature is disrupted, casting a dark shadow over the urban landscape. 
This intertwined relationship between urban waste and environmental degradation underscores the urgent need for comprehensive waste management strategies, urging society to confront the challenge head-on and embrace sustainable practices to safeguard our precious environment from the onslaught of urban refuse.
Team Mars want to help mitigate that problem with ZURI Bin.
ZURI bin is a next generation smart bin that automaticaly reports itself to the authorities once it is full. It opens itself when one comes to dump trash and closes when he or she leaves. One can review the level of their trash can and take necessary actoin before it is filled.
Once it is full it will deny someone access to the bin. Once it is 80 % ful it reports itself to the authories so emptying will be punctual and no overflowing will occur.
But ZURI bin is more than just a bin. Its a personality. With the intergration of an app, ussd and website one can report someone's trash on any device be it smart phone or just a phone. 
Most of the poorly dumped trash end up rotting at the paths of our streets. They emit gases which leads to global warming and also are non-biodegradable thus polluting our environment.
With ZURI bin any noble citizen can report such sitings not only the authorities will come and mitigate that issue but also the recylcling companies we will be selling to this information and the best part is for the noble citizen all that is free of charge. And you know Kenyans with free things, they honestly, cannot resist.
All that data is contained in our data base in neat pie charts and tables with the help of data science tools. 
This data is what we are planning to sell to the recycling companies as those trash are their raw materials.
This implies that what was once trash will become something useful(Gold). We call it "rebirth of trash".
The website and application is deployed in microsoft azure.
We are using mqtt api to connect the hardware to the software.
We are also using api's to trnasmit data from the website to our database.
We tested our api's using postman.
Finally we used Github to collaboratively make a working prototype.
Our target market is mostly recylcing companies as we wil be selling the data in subscr4iption basis. The higher your subscription the more the location they get on their raw materials.
We believe our project is needed mainly because with proper waste disposal strategies we will be able to mitigate more than 50% of climate change as over 60% of climate change is caused by poor waste disposal.
The advantages of zuri bin is waste disposal will be fast and efficient and also unseen waste by the authorities could be accounted for because one can report such.
For the technology part we are using sensors and actuators such as ultrasonic sensors and servo motors in the physical bin and a raspberry pi as the brains behind all of it. 
We have also incorporated application that runs on both android and ios devices together with ussd and website.
